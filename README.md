⚙️ Model ArchitectureThe neural network is a simple CNN designed to process the $28 \times 28$ grayscale images.The architecture consists of:Input: $1 \times 28 \times 28$ image.Conv1: Conv2d(1, 32, kernel_size=3) $\rightarrow$ ReLU $\rightarrow$ MaxPool2d(2)Conv2: Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3) $\rightarrow$ ReLU $\rightarrow$ MaxPool2d(2)Flatten: Converts feature maps into a 1D vector (64 channels $\times 5 \times 5 = \mathbf{1600}$ features).Dropout: Dropout2d(0.25) to prevent overfitting.FC1 (Linear): Linear(1600, 128) $\rightarrow$ ReLUFC2 (Output): Linear(128, 10) (Output layer with 10 classes for digits 0-9).🏃 Getting StartedPrerequisitesYou will need Python 3.7+ and the following libraries:Bashpip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn pandas
Execution StepsClone the repository (if hosted on GitHub) or open the Jupyter Notebook (MNIST_Digit_Classifier.ipynb).Run the cells sequentially:Data Loading: The script automatically downloads and normalizes the MNIST data.Model Definition: Defines the Net class.Training Loop: Runs the training over several epochs (e.g., 10), recording loss and accuracy.Evaluation: Generates the accuracy plot and confusion matrix.Inference: Displays a sample of predicted digits.📊 ResultsThe training successfully pushed the model's performance beyond the $95\%$ accuracy target.MetricValueFinal Test Accuracy98.7%Loss FunctionCross-Entropy LossOptimizerSGD (lr=0.01, momentum=0.5)(Include the plots you generated here, perhaps as static images in your repository, and reference them in the README.)Test Accuracy CurveA plot showing the increase in test accuracy over the training epochs.Confusion MatrixA heatmap showing the classification results, highlighting where misclassifications occurred (e.g., confusing '4' and '9').
